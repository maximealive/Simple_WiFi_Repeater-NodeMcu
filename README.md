# Simple Wi-Fi Repeater - NodeMcu
It's not properly equal of a repeater because of limited NodeMcu range and speed for this "simple Wi-Fi repeater".

In case of issue -> erase & upload stock firmware(bin folder).

## Tutorial
- Install driver 'CH341SER_win.zip'
- Connect NodeMcu and check com port (Control Panel >> Device Manager >> Ports)
- Open 'flash_download_tools_v3.6.8.exe' -> for me was ESP8266
- Put the same settings as in picture(BAUD, FLASH-SIZE, etc)
